Generates a quote from the world, and a quote from the bible.

There are multiple ways to make this app better, but I will do so later:
More functionality with regards to choosing WHICH Bible verses. This requires the use of a hashmap and more logic to handle duplicates, and inline <b> tags, because NET Bible's API is very inflexible (but it's free and convenient).
